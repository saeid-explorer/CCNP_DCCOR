** VXLAN and VNI
  - There are some problems in traditional Data Centers
    - Vlans are limited (4K)
    - We have to use STP, FHRP, VPC which have their own problems
    - We have to use L3 PODs (L3 at edge) which are problematic

 - VXLAN helps us to better scale our network by two primary ways
    1) It will increase the number of Broadcast Domains that are available to us
    2) It's gonna extend L2 over L3

 - When we enable VXLAN on a switch, it's become known as VTEP(VXLAN Tunneling EndPoint)
 - One VLAN is going to be mapped to a single VNI(Virtual Network Identifier)
 - Then each VNI is going to be extended through a L3 boundary and connect to another VTEP which receives the 
   VNIs which has encapsulated the traffic that VXLAN enabled us to send.
 - Then the destination VTEP is going to translate VNI back into the individual VLANs that were originally
   connecting with.

 - VXLAN header is a 8 Byte header
    - 1B -> Flags
    - 3B -> VNI (almost 16Million VLANs)
    - 4B -> Reserved

  - Scoping the VNIs
    - There are two primary ways of scoping VNIs
      1) Network Scope
      2) Local Scope(locally significant VNI)
      
      - Network-wide scope means that if we were to apply a VNI to a particular VLAN, the question we're
        going to ask is whether this VNI is significant only to the local switch or to the entire Network.
      - Scoping Network-wide means that the specific VNI will also get mapped to the same Vlan on the
        destination VTEP
      - Benefit of Network-wide Scoping is that it's SIMPLE(i.e. VNI gonna point to the same VLAN in the
        entire Network)
      - Downside of Network-wide Scoping is Management. Because we have to be a worry about that the specific
        VNI is reserved everywhere and we can't repurpose that VNI by accident anywhere in the Network.
